## Objective

Provide pre-built skills and AI agents for common development workflows, eliminating manual agent configuration.

## What This Enables

**Current State (v0.3.0):**
- MCP servers auto-configured
- Beads workflows functional
- Manual skill and agent creation

**Target State (v0.4.0):**
- **Pre-built skills library** for common development tasks
- **Specialized AI agents** for different domains (database, testing, deployment, API)
- **Automatic skill installation** based on project preset
- **Zero-configuration agents** that work immediately

## Skills Library

### Database Management Skills
- `db:migrate` - Run database migrations with validation
- `db:seed` - Seed development data with proper relations
- `db:backup` - Create timestamped database backups
- `db:reset` - Reset database to clean state safely

### Testing Automation Skills
- `test:generate` - Generate comprehensive test cases for components
- `test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with detailed reporting
- `test:coverage` - Generate and analyze coverage reports
- `test:fix` - Automatically fix failing tests where possible

### Deployment Skills
- `deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging with health checks
- `deploy:prod` - Production deployment with rollback capability
- `deploy:rollback` - Safe rollback to previous version
- `deploy:health` - Comprehensive health and performance checks

### API Development Skills
- `api:generate` - Generate API endpoints from specifications
- `api:test` - Automated API testing with validation
- `api:docs` - Generate comprehensive API documentation
- `api:validate` - Validate API schemas and responses

## User Impact

```bash
# Before v0.4.0 (manual agent setup)
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app
# Manual skill creation and agent configuration
# Hours of setup for functional AI workflows

# After v0.4.0 (pre-built agents work immediately)
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app

# Ask AI to handle database tasks
"Can you run migrations and seed the development database?"

# Request testing assistance
"Generate comprehensive tests for the user authentication system"

# Get deployment help
"Deploy to staging and run health checks"

# API development support
"Generate API documentation for all endpoints"
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] AI agents work immediately without configuration
- [ ] Skills library provides value for all preset types (SaaS, ecommerce, blog, etc.)
- [ ] 80%+ of common development tasks can be handled by AI
- [ ] Setup time for functional AI workflows: 0 minutes (vs. hours previously)

## Implementation Tracking

Key deliverables:

- **Skills Registry System** - Catalog and loading system for skills
- **Automatic Skill Installation** - Deploy skills based on project configuration
- **Specialized Agent Templates** - Pre-configured agents for different domains
