## Objective

Automate issue tracking setup with Beads integration, providing immediate AI-driven project management workflows.

## What This Enables

**Current State (v0.2.0):**
- MCP servers work automatically
- AI has immediate tool access
- Manual issue tracking setup with `bd init`

**Target State (v0.3.0):**
- **Automatic Beads initialization** during project generation
- **PBS workflow templates** pre-configured for Plan-Build-Ship methodology
- **Preset-specific workflows** tailored to SaaS/ecommerce/blog projects
- **AI agent integration** for automatic issue creation and management

## User Impact

```bash
# Before v0.3.0
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app
bd init                    # Manual step
bd onboard                 # Manual configuration
# Manual workflow setup

# After v0.3.0
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app
bd ready                   # Issues already created and ready to work
# PBS workflows pre-configured
# AI can create and manage issues automatically
```

## Preset-Specific Workflows

**SaaS Preset:**
- User story planning and management
