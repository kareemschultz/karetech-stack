## Request

Create an interactive, step-by-step tutorial that guides new users through their first KareTech Stack project.

## Current State

- Comprehensive written documentation
- Quick start guide with commands
- Examples and use cases

## Proposed Enhancement

### Interactive Tutorial Flow
1. **Project Creation** - Guided CLI wizard walkthrough
2. **Development Environment** - Setting up and running the project
3. **First Customizations** - Making basic changes (theme, content)
4. **AI Integration** - Setting up and using AI features
5. **Deployment** - Publishing the project

### Tutorial Features
- **Interactive code blocks** that users can copy and execute
- **Progress tracking** with checkboxes and completion indicators
- **Troubleshooting sections** for common issues
- **Video walkthroughs** for complex concepts
- **Sandbox environment** for safe experimentation

## User Impact

- Faster onboarding for new developers
- Reduced support questions
- Higher success rate for first-time users
- Better understanding of AI workflow features

## Implementation Ideas

**Option 1: Web-based Tutorial**
- Interactive website with guided steps
- Embedded code execution
- Progress saving across sessions

**Option 2: CLI-integrated Tutorial**
- `bunx create-karetech-stack --tutorial`
- In-terminal guided experience
- Automatic validation of steps

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Web tutorial with CLI integration
- QR codes for mobile/desktop switching
- Both self-paced and guided options

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 90%+ tutorial completion rate
- [ ] Reduced time-to-first-success for new users
- [ ] Fewer "getting started" support questions
- [ ] Higher user engagement and retention

## Community Contribution
