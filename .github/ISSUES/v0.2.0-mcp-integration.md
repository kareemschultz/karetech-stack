## Objective

Eliminate manual MCP server setup by providing pre-configured connections to common development tools out-of-the-box.

## What This Enables

**Current State (v0.1.0):**
- PBS documentation generated
- `.claude/` directory structure created
- Manual MCP server configuration required

**Target State (v0.2.0):**
- **GitHub integration** - Automatic repo connection for issues and PRs
- **Database integration** - Auto-configured for PostgreSQL/Turso based on project
- **Filesystem integration** - Safe project file access for AI
- **Playwright integration** - Ready for AI-driven testing workflows

## User Impact

```bash
# Before v0.2.0 (manual setup required)
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app
# User must manually configure .claude/settings.json
# User must manually install MCP servers
# User must manually set up authentication

# After v0.2.0 (fully automated)
bunx create-karetech-stack my-app --preset saas
cd my-app
bun dev
# Claude Code immediately works with GitHub, database, files
# No manual configuration required
# AI can manage issues, run tests, access project files
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Generated projects have functional MCP servers without configuration
- [ ] AI can immediately access GitHub, database, and project files
- [ ] Setup time for AI workflows reduced from 30+ minutes to 0 minutes
- [ ] 90%+ of users can use AI features immediately after project generation

## Implementation Tracking

Detailed implementation tracked in internal Beads issues. Key deliverables:

- **MCP Server Registry** - Curated list of vetted servers
- **Auto-Installation System** - Automatic server setup during scaffolding
- **Health Validation** - Verify server connections work correctly
- **Template Integration** - Generate proper `.claude/settings.json`

## Timeline

- **Target Release:** February 2026
- **Development Effort:** 25 development days
- **Status:** Planning phase

## Community

This milestone will make KareTech Stack the first scaffolding tool to provide **zero-configuration AI development workflows**. Community feedback welcome on:

- Which MCP servers are most important to you?
- What development tools should be prioritized?
- What authentication flows work best for your team?
